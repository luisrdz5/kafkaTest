# Backend Exercise

## OVERVIEW

The application listen to tweets and track certain keywords and those tweets will be available through an API.

## GOALS

Listen to tweets and identify the required keywords
Make an API REST with the tweets.

## SPECIFICATIONS

The keywords weâ€™re going to listen to, are: platzi, open source and node Twitter API (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview) 
In case of a keyword match, the tweet will be sent to a RabbitMQ queue, which will be processed and saved to Redis. We will also have a REST API exposing the tweets we have saved.


## HOW IT WORKS

The aplication has 5 containers:

- Tracker: This container get information from twitter and send it to rabbitmq 
- RabbitMQ: Is a Message broker 
- Worker: This container read the information from the message broker and put them into redis 
- Redis: It's an in-memory data structure store, used as a database
- API: This container create an API to consume the tweets 

This is to make an scalable infrastructure and there works in that way

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

You need to install docker and docker-compose, you can get information about the instalation in:

```
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
```

#### Environment Variables

```
PORT=<port of the API>
NODE_ENV=development | production
API_KEY_TWITTER
API_SECRET_KEY_TWITTER
ACCESS_TOKEN_TWITTER
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_TWITTER
STREAM_URL=statuses/filter
KEYWORDS=node,platzi,open source
RABBITMQ_SERVER=rabbitmq
RABBITMQ_USER
RABBITMQ_PWD
RABBITMQ_QUEUE=twitter_queue
REDIS_SERVER=redis
```

### Installing

To install the project in your server/machine you need tu build the docker-containers with the command:

```
docker-compose build
```

after you can start the services with the command:

```
docker-compose up
```

open the api endpont in your navigator.

```
http://<your ip>:port/api/
```
